context: |
  Tech stack: Python 3.11+, FreqAI (Freqtrade), Docker
  ML libraries: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, NGBoost, scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas
  Reinforcement learning: Stable-Baselines3 (ReforceXY strategy)
  Testing: pytest
  Domain: Algorithmic crypto trading strategies with machine learning

  Key strategies:
  - QuickAdapter: Regression-based strategy with zigzag labeling and adaptive thresholds
  - ReforceXY: Reinforcement learning strategy with customizable reward functions

  Conventions from .github/copilot-instructions.md:
  - Prefer established design patterns (factory, singleton, strategy)
  - DRY: avoid duplication of logic, data, and naming
  - Single source of truth: maintain canonical defaults for configuration tunables
  - Naming coherence: semantically accurate names, avoid ambiguous synonyms
  - English-only: code, tests, logs, comments, documentation
  - Tests-first mindset: add or update tests before refactoring or feature changes
  - Conventional Commits format for PR titles and commit messages

  Configuration guidelines:
  - Dynamic generation: derive CLI/config options from canonical defaults
  - Merge precedence: defaults < user options < explicit overrides
  - Validation: enforce constraints (choices, ranges, types) at the option layer

  Statistical conventions:
  - Report effect sizes alongside test statistics and p-values
  - Document divergence metric direction explicitly
  - Use confidence intervals when feasible

# Per-artifact rules (optional)
# Add custom rules for specific artifacts.
# Example:
#   rules:
#     proposal:
#       - Keep proposals under 500 words
#       - Always include a "Non-goals" section
#     tasks:
#       - Break tasks into chunks of max 2 hours
